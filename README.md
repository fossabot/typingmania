TypingMania Typing Game
=======================

TypingMania is what I hoped to be a game like TypingMania Odyssey.
I created this because I was frustrated that the setting up of
TypingMania Odyssey is so complicated and all help are in Japanese.

This game is far from complete, but the main component is done
(Song playing and typing). I will make documentation on how to create song later.

This game is coded purely in Javascript and HTML5.

Only browser tested are latest version of Chrome and Firefox.
